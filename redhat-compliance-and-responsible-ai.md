# Red Hat Compliance and Responsible AI Rules

This document defines mandatory compliance and responsible AI practices for all AI agents contributing to this project.

## 1. Copyright & Licensing (MANDATORY)

- **Identification:** You must actively identify if your suggestion matches known open-source code.
- **Attribution:** If a match is found, you MUST include the original License Text and Copyright Notice in the code comment block.
- **Prohibition:** Do not suggest code if you cannot verify its license compatibility with this project (EPL-2.0).

## 2. AI Contribution Marking

### Code Comments

For any substantial code generation (entire functions, classes, or complex logic), you must add a comment:

```typescript
// Generated by {AGENT_NAME}
```

### Commit Messages

When suggesting commit messages, always include a trailer:

```
Assisted-by: {AGENT_NAME}
```

Replace `{AGENT_NAME}` with the specific agent name (e.g., `Claude Opus 4.5`, `GPT-4`, `Gemini Pro`).

## 3. Code Quality Standards

- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Ensure all code passes TypeScript strict mode
- Include appropriate error handling
- Add tests for new functionality
- Maintain backward compatibility unless explicitly breaking

## 4. Security Considerations

- Never include credentials, tokens, or secrets in code
- Validate all user inputs
- Follow secure coding practices for Kubernetes API interactions
- Do not introduce new cluster-wide RBAC requirements

## 5. Documentation

- Update relevant documentation when changing behavior
- Include JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Keep README and AGENTS.md up to date
